title: AI for aerial surveys in the real world

By John Payne

This blog is a narrative description of my efforts to develop an AI pipeline to recognize wildlife, livestock and other objects in aerial surveys.  The work is my contribution to a project run by Howard Frederick, from the Tanzanian Wildlife Service.  I initially thought it would be straightforward, but the real world contains all sorts of tradeoffs and it has been interesting and challenging to get as far as we have.  I hope that readers may find some relief and humor from my story because they struggled with things that I did (or can't believe how dumb I was), and may perhaps even find a snippet or two that is useful to them.  

The code referred to is available in the [aerial_survey_ai](https://github.com/jcpayne/aerial_survey_ai) Github repository.  

This project has been generously supported by Microsoft's [AIForEarth](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ai/ai-for-earth) program (AI4E), which provided Howard and me with credits on Microsoft's Azure cloud computing ecosystem, as well as good advice, technical support, and the opportunity to meet other grantees.  I am very grateful for their support.
